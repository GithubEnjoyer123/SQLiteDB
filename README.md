## Simple DB created with C++!

bullseye is the mock DB file I added to showcase some values. Here are the steps to run the program.

1. Make sure you have the G++ and GCC compilers installed on your system. Find it in your system [here](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
##
2. Run the g++ compiler on main and give the file a name (make sure everything is in the same folder!)
   
   ```g++ .\main.cpp -l sqlite3 -o Database```
This will create a file named Database.exe

3. Run the program. Feel free to find it in file explorer and double click to execute, OR run the following
   ```.\Database.exe```
